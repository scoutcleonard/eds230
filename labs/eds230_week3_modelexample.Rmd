Try implementing Okun's Law as a function in R. 

In the code chunk below, I write a function which represents Okun's Law, which calculate % change in gross national product (GNP) using the change in unemployment rate, as a percentage. The returned decimal value represents the percent change in GNP. 

```{r}
okuns_law = function(deltaEmp, slope, intercept) {
  deltaGNP = slope * deltaEmp + intercept
  return(deltaGNP)
}
```

What is the change in GDP for unemployment rate change of 3%? 

```{r}
okuns_law(deltaEmp = 3, slope = 1.827, intercept = 0.856)
```
